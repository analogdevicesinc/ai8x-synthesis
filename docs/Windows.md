# Neural Network Training on Windows

December 8, 2022

The preferred and most compatible way to train networks is using the *[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/ai8x-synthesis/blob/develop/docs/WSL2.md).* However, WSL2 is not always available. The instructions in this document demonstrate how to train networks natively on Windows, without WSL2.

## Requirements

### 64-bit Windows

Windows **must** run in 64-bit mode. To check, use the Start menu and type “About”.

### Packages

Several applications and packages are needed. Some of the installation steps may require administrator privileges.

#### Analog Devices MSDK

Install the [Analog Devices MSDK](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/software/software-download?swpart=SFW0010820A) for MAX78000/MAX78002.

#### Python

Install the latest available version of Python 3.8 from [python.org](https://python.org/downloads/windows/). As of late 2021, the latest available 3.8 version with a Windows installer was 3.8.10.

Run the installer, and add Python to the Path:

Allow the installer to disable the PATH length limit.

#### git

A git binary is required. Download git from [gitforwindows.org](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

During setup, there are options can be selected for line endings and system settings. The following settings are recommended:

##### GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE Environment Variable

Next, add a new environment variable that points to the location of git.exe. In the Start menu, type “environment” and open the Control panel. Under “System Properties” - “Advanced”, click “Environment Variables…” and add a “New User Variable” with the variable name `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` and the “mapped” location of git.exe. This value is typically `/c/Program Files/Git/cmd/git.exe` as shown in the screen shot below.

<img src="environment-variable.png" alt="environment-variable" style="zoom:50%;" />

<img src="new-variable.png" alt="new-variable" style="zoom:67%;" />

It is also possible that if git was installed for just the local user (usually when installed without admin rights), git may be in the user’s `AppData` folder instead of `Program Files`:

    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\cmd

By default, Windows hides folders such as the user’s AppData folder as “hidden items”. In order to view these files, hidden items need to be [enabled in the File Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5).

If git was installed in the `AppData` folder, the environment variable should look as follows:

## MAX78000 Training and Synthesis Repositories

The next step is to clone the ai8x-training and ai8x-synthesis repositories.

Open a MinGW shell using Start - Maxim Integrated SDK - MinGW:

Next, change to the target directory (the default is  `C:\MaximSDK\Tools\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\<name>\`).

Check out the training and synthesis repositories as detailed in the [main documentation](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/ai8x-synthesis/blob/develop/README.md#upstream-code).



## Troubleshooting

### Could not Install Packages due to an OSError

When `pip3 install -U pip setuptools wheel` returns that it could not uninstall pip3.exe, simply ignore the error and repeat the command one more time.

### CUDNN_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR

On Windows, it may be necessary to limit the number of PyTorch workers to 1 to avoid crashes or internal errors such as `CUDNN_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR` in the training software.

Add `--workers=1` when running any training script, for example;

```shell
$ scripts/train_mnist.sh --workers=1
```

### Git Executable Error

When running `ai8xize.py` , the software may display an error regarding `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` as shown below. Please set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` environment variable as shown [above](#GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE Environment Variable).

As an alternative, run the following before calling `ai8xize.py`:

```shell
$ source scripts/set-git
```
